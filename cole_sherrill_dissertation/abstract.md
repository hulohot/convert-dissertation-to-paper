# Abstract

This paper presents the first comprehensive design flow for implementing Multi-Threshold NULL Convention Logic (MTNCL) circuits using commercial Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools. While MTNCL offers advantages over synchronous designs in terms of power consumption and electromagnetic interference, its adoption has been limited by the lack of automated design methodologies. We introduce a novel RTL-to-GDS flow that enables the synthesis of MTNCL circuits from standard synchronous RTL descriptions, incorporating critical timing constraints to ensure reliable operation. The flow addresses four fundamental timing assumptions in MTNCL architecture and provides systematic solutions for sleep network implementation and optimization.

Our methodology is validated through the implementation of three complex circuits: 64-bit adders, Montgomery modular multipliers, and AES-256 cores. Results demonstrate significant improvements over traditional structural designs, achieving up to 140% higher throughput in high-performance implementations while reducing active energy by up to 28.6% and static power by 42.9% in low-power configurations. The success of these implementations suggests that previous performance limitations in MTNCL circuits may be attributed to design methodology rather than inherent architectural constraints.

This work contributes to the field by: (1) establishing a standardized approach for MTNCL circuit synthesis using commercial tools, (2) developing novel timing constraints for reliability and optimization, and (3) demonstrating the viability of MTNCL as a competitive alternative to synchronous design in modern deep submicron technologies. The proposed methodology paves the way for broader adoption of asynchronous design in commercial applications while maintaining compatibility with industry-standard EDA tools.
